ONAP SDK is a client library written in Python for building applications to
work with ONAP. The project aims to provide a consistent and complete set of
interactions with ONAPâ€™s many services, along with complete documentation,
examples, and tools.

Using few python commands, you should be able to onboard, distribute models and
instantiate xNFs.

First beta release deals with ONAP "Legacy" APIs but new
APIs, CDS and policy integration is planned for next releases.
